	abstract = {Ontology is an important element in Semantic Web. It is able to represent scattered knowledge from unstructured text into a structured representation. However, extracting domain knowledge from the unstructured text for constructing ontologies is time consuming task. Thus, it is desire to perform the task automatic or semi-automatic. The task of extracting ontological elements automatically or semi-automatic is also called the Ontology Learning. There are limited studies on using Ontology Learning approach for extracting the elements from Quran text. Most of the ontology construction is done manual and focuses only on a few domains. Hence, it is a need to explore another domain and at the same time try minimizing the time. Recent advances in the Ontology Learning used the NER method to extract the knowledge. This paper proposed a framework of Ontology Learning to construct ontology from Quran text translation. The framework includes extracting ontological elements and constructing ontology from the extracted elements. Apart from that, an initial experiment based on the framework provides results in extracting elements such as concepts. The experiment used the NER method based on Information Extraction approach. Results indicate that the method is able to extract concepts.},

The representation of biomedical knowledge has been found of great use for biomedical text mining and integration of biomedical data. In this chapter we present an unsupervised method for learning arbitrary semantic relations between ontological concepts in the molecular biology domain. The method uses the GENIA corpus and ontology to learn relations between annotated named-entities by means of several standard natural language processing techniques. An in-depth analysis of the output evaluates the accuracy of the model and its potentials for text mining and ontology building applications. The proposed learning method does not require domain-specific optimization or tuning and can be straightforwardly applied to arbitrary domains, provided the basic processing components exist.},

	abstract = {Generating semantic lexicons semi-automatically could be a great time saver, relative to creating them by hand. In this paper, we present an algorithm for extracting potential entries for a category from an on-line corpus, based upon a small set of exemplars. Our algorithm finds more correct terms and fewer incorrect ones than previous work in this area. Additionally, the entries that are generated potentially provide broader coverage of the category than would occur to an individual coding them by hand. Our algorithm finds many terms not included within Wordnet (many more than previous algorithms), and could be viewed as an ``enhancer'' of existing broad-coverage resources.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICDE.2000.839475},
	abstract = {The paper describes the methodology and the software development of XWRAP, an XML-enabled wrapper construction system for semi-automatic generation of wrapper programs. By XML-enabled we mean that the metadata about information content that are implicit in the original Web pages will be extracted and encoded explicitly as XML tags in the wrapped documents. In addition, the query based content filtering process is performed against the XML documents. The XWRAP wrapper generation framework has three distinct features. First, it explicitly separates tasks of building wrappers that are specific to a Web source from the tasks that are repetitive for any source, and uses a component library to provide basic building blocks for wrapper programs. Second, it provides a user friendly interface program to allow wrapper developers to generate their wrapper code with a few mouse clicks. Third and most importantly, we introduce and develop a two-phase code generation framework. The first phase utilizes an interactive interface facility to encode the source-specific metadata knowledge identified by individual wrapper developers as declarative information extraction rules. The second phase combines the information extraction rules generated at the first phase with the XWRAP component library to construct an executable wrapper program for the given Web source. We report the initial experiments on performance of the XWRAP code generation system and the wrapper programs generated by XWRAP},
